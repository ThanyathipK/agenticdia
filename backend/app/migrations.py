"""Alembic migration runner for Agentic AI.

Replaces the previous ad-hoc startup migrations (routes/migrations.py) with
proper versioned Alembic migrations. Migrations are stored in
backend/alembic/versions/ and tracked in the alembic_version table.

The Alembic env.py module handles the async engine connection lifecycle,
so this module simply delegates to Alembic's command API.
