"""
Document processing helpers — token routing, markdown chunking and DRAFT-ONLY
requirements extraction for uploaded documents.

Separation of concerns enforced by the product intent (see ``routes/documents.py``):

* Storage is separate from LLM feeding. Uploads persist the FULL converted
  markdown regardless of token size (``MAX_UPLOAD_MB`` is the only size gate).
* Token budgets apply exclusively to the explicit "process this document"
  path. That path routes the document to the gatherer either in one call
  (``token_count <= DOCUMENT_BUDGET``) or across sequential chunks (each
  ~``DOCUMENT_CHUNK_SIZE`` tokens with ``DOCUMENT_CHUNK_OVERLAP`` overlap).
* Extraction is DRAFT-ONLY. Nothing in this module ever writes requirements,
  user stories or acceptance criteria; the merged draft is carried in a
  ``pending_action`` and only becomes DB state after explicit user confirmation
  through the existing confirm-action flow.

The gatherer LLM call reuses the same prompt + ``GatheredRequirements`` schema
that ``agents.gatherer_node`` uses, so document extraction stays consistent with
interactive requirement gathering.

    --------
    - A document already within ``chunk_size`` returns a single chunk.
    - Chunks are packed line-by-line so headings/paragraphs are never sliced
      mid-line, and the last ``overlap`` tokens of each chunk are carried into
      the next chunk so boundary context is not clipped.
    - No content is ever dropped: every source line appears in at least one
      chunk (overlap duplicates content — it never removes it).

    Args:
        text: Full converted-markdown document body.
        chunk_size: Target token budget per chunk (defaults to settings).
        overlap: Tokens of the previous chunk repeated at the next chunk start.
        token_count: Precomputed ``count_tokens(text)`` when the caller already
            measured it (routes do), skipping one redundant full-document
            tokenization pass on large documents.
