"""
PRD section service — the PRD as a collection of editable, lockable, versioned
PARTS.

The official Krungsri Nimble PRD always renders as the SAME nine parts in the
preview (cover, stakeholders, version history, reviews, contents, 1. business
& strategic overview, 2. product scope, 3. technical & operational, 4.
appendix). This module:

  - defines those canonical parts (:data:`CANONICAL_PRD_SECTIONS`),
  - splits a full PRD markdown document into those parts
    (:func:`split_markdown_sections`) using the EXACT same rules as the
    frontend ``parsePRDToSections`` (``src/utils/markdown.ts``), so a
    ``section_key`` always identifies the same part the user sees,
  - seeds the ``prd_sections`` table for a project on first access
    (:func:`ensure_sections_seeded`),
  - syncs a freshly generated (LaTeX or markdown) PRD into the table while
    PRESERVING human-owned / locked sections (:func:`sync_sections_from_prd`),
  - stitches the stored parts back into the full document
    (:func:`assemble_document_markdown`).

Section content is always stored as MARKDOWN (the preview/human-editing
format). LaTeX sources are normalized via ``latex_service.prd_to_markdown``
before splitting; markdown sources pass through untouched.
