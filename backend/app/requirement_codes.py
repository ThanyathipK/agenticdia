"""
Canonical ``REQ-###`` requirement-code helpers — the SINGLE source of truth for
requirement numbering.

Nothing in the codebase should hardcode a literal code such as ``"REQ-001"``:

* A hardcoded code on a fresh board is what let a brand-new project start at
  ``REQ-002`` (a seeded/default requirement claimed ``REQ-001`` before the first
  requirement the user actually gathered) and it silently pinned numbering when
  the sequence legitimately needed to advance.
* The prefix, the number a fresh board starts at, the sentinel used for
  not-yet-numbered rows and the ``used codes -> next code`` rule all live here so
  every caller (agents, routes, document import, repositories) derives the same
  answer.
