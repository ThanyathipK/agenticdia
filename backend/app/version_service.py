"""
PRD version ledger service.

Every change to the document — an AI regeneration ("Generate PRD") or a manual
part edit / revert — is captured as an immutable ``prd_versions`` snapshot so
the Version History tab can show exactly how many versions exist and what each
one changed::

  - ``record_prd_version``  computes the per-section change records for the new
    snapshot (created / updated / unchanged / locked_preserved), persists the
    version row, advances ``requirement_states.version_number`` and returns it.
  - ``diff_versions``       renders a section-level line diff between any two
    stored versions for the interactive Difference Analysis pane.

Lock contract: when a section is locked (or human-owned, ``ai_generatable``
False) and the incoming source would have changed it, the linkage is recorded
as ``locked_preserved`` — the snapshot still advances, but the ledger proves the
lock was honoured.
