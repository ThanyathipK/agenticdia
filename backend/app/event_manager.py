"""In-memory SSE event manager with single-worker guard and bounded replay.

Provides a simple pub/sub mechanism where state changes publish SSE notifications
to connected clients. Like the rate limiter, the bus is **in-process** and safe
only for a single OS process (one uvicorn worker). If multiple workers ran, each
would keep its own subscriber set, so events published on one worker would never
reach SSE clients connected to another -- clients would see missing/duplicate
streams. To make that failure impossible to miss, :func:`verify_single_worker_guarantee`
is invoked at startup and **refuses to boot** when more than one worker is
detected (unless the operator explicitly opts into the weaker posture).

Each project also keeps a bounded ring buffer of recent events (length
``SSE_HISTORY_BUFFER_SIZE``). SSE clients can replay events they missed while
disconnected: a browser ``EventSource`` automatically reconnects with a
``Last-Event-ID`` header (the last ``id:`` field it observed), and a subscribing
client with a ``last_event_id`` is seeded with every buffered event written while
it was away. The buffer is process-local, so a full server restart loses live
history (a reconnecting client's project state is recovered via the ``connected``
handshake refresh); ordering and replay are guaranteed within a process.
