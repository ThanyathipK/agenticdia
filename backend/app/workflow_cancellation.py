"""Server-side cancellation support for the multi-agent workflow (Stop button).

The long-running ``POST /api/process-requirements`` handler executes the whole
LangGraph pipeline (intent detection, gatherer/auditor/architect agents) inside
a single request. Pressing Stop in the UI must terminate that work *on the
server*, not merely make the browser stop waiting.

Mechanism
---------
1. At request start the handler registers its ``asyncio.Task`` here, keyed by
   ``project_id`` (see ``app.routes.requirements``).
2. ``POST /api/process-requirements/cancel?project_id=...`` looks the task up
   and calls ``task.cancel()``, which raises ``asyncio.CancelledError`` at the
   task's current await point — including mid-LLM-call, so the outbound LM
   Studio HTTP request is aborted too.
3. The handler catches ``CancelledError``, skips every persistence step
   (pending actions, assistant messages, SSE publishes) and returns a
   ``{"status": "cancelled"}`` response.

The registry is deliberately in-process: the app enforces a single uvicorn
worker (see ``app.event_manager.verify_single_worker_guarantee``), so a plain
dict keyed by project id is correct and lock-free on the single event loop.
