"""Central pytest fixtures shared across the backend suite.

The API routes enforce authentication (JWT bearer) and per-project ownership.
Most route-level tests exercise business logic, not the auth layer — the auth
layer has its own dedicated suites (tests/test_auth.py and
tests/test_authorization_enforcement.py, which see the REAL dependencies).

So by default every test runs with:

1. ``get_current_user`` / ``require_project_owner`` (and the SSE ``*_flexible``
   variants) overridden to return a synthetic authenticated user, and
2. the ``verify_project_access`` calls that routes make directly (body/query
   project ids) patched to a no-op via monkeypatch.
