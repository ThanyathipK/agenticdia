"""The Architect must refresh the Mermaid flow diagram on every PRD generation.

When the PRD is (re)filled, ``architect_node`` asks the LLM with the project's
own dataset (business goals / actors / requirements / user stories / acceptance
criteria) and stores the returned Mermaid ``flowchart TD`` source in
``requirement_states.generated_diagrams``; the API surfaces it as
``mermaid_diagram``. A diagram failure must never fail the PRD generation.
